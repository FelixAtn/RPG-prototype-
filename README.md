# 2D GAME ENGINE PROTOTYPE 

Welcome to my 2D game prototype project! Built using **SFML** and **Visual Studio 2022**, this prototype is ready to compile and run. Follow the instructions below to set up the project and start the game.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2022** (or compatible C++ compiler)
- **SFML** (included in `dependencies`)
- **YAML-CPP** (included in `dependencies`)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FelixAtn/RPG-prototype
   ```

2. **Download the dependencies**:
   - The `dependencies/` folder includes all required libraries and DLL files.

3. **Copy DLLs**:
   - To run the game, copy all DLL files from `dependencies/dlls/` to the `src/` directory (where the game’s executable will be).

## Building the Game

1. **Open the Solution**:
   - Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio 2022.

2. **Build**:
   - Ensure your configuration is set to `x64-[Debug or Release]`, and then build the project.

## Running the Game

1. **Run from Visual Studio**:
   - After building, you can run the game directly from Visual Studio.

2. **Run from Executable**:
   - If running from the executable after building, make sure the required DLLs and files (found in `src`) are present in the same folder.
